# Manage Docker-Compose via Node.js

`docker-compose` is a small library that allows you to run [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)(which is still required) via Node.js. This is useful to bootstrap test environments. You might also generate your `docker-compose.yml` files using [composefile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/composefile).

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev docker-compose
```

## Usage

`docker-compose` current supports these commands:

* `upAll(options)` - Create and start containers - uses the `-d` flag due to non interactive mode as long as `options.interactive` is not true
* `upMany(services, options)` - Create and start containers specified in `services` - uses the `-d` flag due to non interactive mode as long as `options.interactive` is not true
* `upOne(service, options)` - Create and start container specified in `service` - uses the `-d` flag due to non interactive mode as long as `options.interactive` is not true
* `down(options)` - Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
* `kill(options)` - Kill containers
* `stop(options)` - Stop services
* `rm(options)` - Remove stopped containers - always uses the `-f` flag due to non interactive mode
* `exec(container, command, options)` - Exec `command` inside `container`, uses `-T` to properly handle stdin & stdout
* `run(container, command, options)` - Run `command` inside `container`, uses `-T` to properly handle stdin & stdout
* `buildAll(options)` - Build all images
* `buildMany(services, options)` - Build images of specified services
* `buildOne(service, options)` - Build image of specified service

All commands return a `Promise({object})` with an stdout and stderr strings
```javascript
{
  out: 'stdout contents' 
  err: 'stderr contents'
}
```

### Example

To start containers based on the `docker-compose.yml` file in your current directory, just call `compose.up` like this:

```javascript
compose.upAll({ cwd: path.join(__dirname), log: true })
  .then(
    () => { console.log('done')}, 
    err => { console.log('something went wrong:', err.message)}
  );
```

To execute command inside a running container
```javascript
compose.exec('node', 'npm install', { cwd: path.join(__dirname) })
```

### Options

`docker-compose` accepts these params:

* `cwd {string}`: mandatory folder path to the `docker-compose.yml`
* `config {(string|string[])}`: custom and/or multiple yml files can be specified (relative to `cwd`)
* `[log] {boolean}`:  optional setting to enable console logging (output of `docker-compose` `stdout`/`stderr` output)
* `[interactive] {boolean}`:  optional setting to start containers in interactive mode as opposed to using the `-d` flag

## Running the tests

While `docker-compose` runs on Node.js 6+, running the tests requires you to use Node.js 8 as they make use of `async/await`.

```
npm test
```
